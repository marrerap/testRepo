    <p>To begin, I have to mention my love for food! Growing up around home kitchens, I enjoyed my 
      time learning and making tortillas and Cha Gio (vietnamese eggrolls). I also enojoy cooking for
      my friends and close family. I'm really looking forward to creating and sharing much more over the 
      coming years. I currently use Windows OS and will be using the WSL2 and UBUNTU 20.04 LTS.
      My hardware consists of:</p>
